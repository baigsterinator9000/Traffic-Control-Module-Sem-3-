# Traffic Control Module Simulation Design
## Introduction
The project is meant to test the approach for designing and implementing a traffic control system for an intersection (Traffic Module) by using a field programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated circuit. The solution is implemented using VHDL and tested out through simulations and then through hardware, using the FGPA.
